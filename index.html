                <h2>Reason for applying for a job</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m focused on extending my web-development skills. My priority goal is to obtain a position in a company that offers a variety of challenging projects with growth potential in terms of individual and professional development.
                    After completing the course «Web application development with javascript», I obtained a more sharpened focus on key concepts in modern web development  and also obtained practical experience by working on my graduation project.
                    After completing the course « React and Angular for web development », I learned to create more flexible and complex interfaces with React and Angular frameworks.
